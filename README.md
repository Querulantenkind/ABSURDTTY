# ABSURDTTY
ABSURDTTY is a small universe of terminal tools that refuse instrumental productivity narratives. If a contribution makes ABSURDTTY useful, it must be rejected or reworked into non-actionable output.  ABSURDTTY is a tiny universe of terminal programs that refuse to optimize your life. They respond. They observe. They do not improve you.
