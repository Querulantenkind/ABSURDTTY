# ABSURDTTY Manifesto

ABSURDTTY is a tiny universe of terminal programs that refuse to optimize your life.
They respond. They observe. They do not improve you.

## Principles
- No objective utility
- Internal consistency
- Deterministic absurdity (when seeded)
- Local-first, no telemetry

## Tools
- noise: the unhelpful instrument
- tty-mood: a mood reader for terminal behavior
